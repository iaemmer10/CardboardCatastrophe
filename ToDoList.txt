Come up with some way to prevent players from walking into text bubbles

Things to test:
Player's preferred camera movement with slighltly slanted cameras
Player understands which button is action and which is jump
If Jump and Talk can be mapped to the same button adaquately (A and X and Right trigger/Left Trigger do the same thing)
Y and B and start and select open menus



text bubble working
text bubble tested


Small model appears above someone's head if they can talk and are in proximity

Pressing interact scales it up and moves it to the top of the screen. 

Continuing the interact button continues talking
 
Walking away past a certain threshold lowers it back down to scale 0, then deletes it 

I would make this object HUD if possible.
